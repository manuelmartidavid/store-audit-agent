"""Golden-entry candidate screen — is this store still fit to be an eval entry?

    python -m planting.screen_candidate --entry 01
    python -m planting.screen_candidate --entry 04 --runs 3

Entries 01 and 04 are stores we do NOT own (design 2026-07-29, D5). Shopify can
reconfigure the Dawn demo, and Forest Whole Foods can change its theme, between
selection and capture day — and the failure mode is silent. A `noindex`
appearing on entry 01 turns the project's only false-positive test into a store
that correctly emits a `critical`, and nothing downstream would report that as
a selection problem rather than an agent problem.

So the selection criteria live here as code and are re-run immediately before
capture. A failing hard gate is a RE-SELECTION TRIGGER, not a defect to label
around.

HARD GATES — any failure disqualifies the candidate:

    reachable    HTTP 200, and no storefront password form
    indexable    no `meta robots: noindex` on any revenue template  -> a critical
    lcp          LCP <= 4.0s on home/collection/pdp                 -> a high
    cls          CLS <= 0.25 on home/collection/pdp                 -> a high
    platform     crawler.fingerprint agrees with the declared platform
    permalinks   WooCommerce only: default /shop|/product-category|/product

RECORDED, never disqualifying:

    robots       which templates robots.txt allows, and any Crawl-delay
    hygiene      title and meta-description presence per template

The hygiene block is deliberately NOT a gate. The defects it finds are real and
belong in the entry's labels — the person writing `expected/findings.md` needs
to know what the store already had before the agent said anything. Screening
them out would mean hunting for a store that flatters the agent, which is the
store-shopping failure this project has warned about twice.

Boundary discipline follows rubric §1: boundary values take the LOWER level, so
LCP exactly 4000 ms and CLS exactly 0.25 both PASS. Gates compare strictly.

This writes nothing. It builds no fixture and no labels.

Exit codes match measure.py: 0 = every hard gate passed · 1 = operational
failure · 2 = a hard gate failed (re-selection trigger).
